## A hostel booking site made using next js and firebase.
The idea behind it is an digital platformon which students can book a hostel room at the beginning of a sememster.
After booking, an **admin** can _approve_ or _reject_ the booking. 
If approved then the student becomes an occupant of the room.
The **admin** can _vacate_ (remove from room) a student.
The site also has a contact form to reach out to the admin. Messages sent here are displayed in the admin panel.

To host this site, I have used vercel,which in my opinion is the best host for nextjs sites...(my opinion)....
